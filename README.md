## For Developers:

You Will Need To Go To E14O/GorillaPadCustomAppProject And Follow The Guide There To Get Your .app First.

This Is The Code Needed To Create Custom Apps:
```csharp
using GorillaPad.Interfaces;

namespace GorillaPad
{
    // make sure the class name is the same as your app name that you exported in the unity project.
    internal class YourApp : AppModule 
    {
        public override string AppName => "YourApp";  // This is what your app will be called on the homepage.
        public override string AppVersion => "0.0.1"; // Enter your app version here (This will be displayed in the bottom left hand corner of your app as defualt).

        // OnAppOpened is called when the user opens the app
        public override void OnAppOpen()
        {
            base.OnAppOpen();
            // Code here will be run before AppContent. So do start up code here and find gameobj inside AppContent to avoid null refrences.
        }

        public override void AppContent()
        {
            base.AppContent();
            // Main app content here (find gamobjs, add button scripts e.c).
        }

        public override void Tick()
        {
            base.Tick();
            // This acts like update. While your app is open, code here will run every frame.
        }

        // Note: DO NOT REMOVE (base.AppContent();) & (base.OnAppOpen();) & (base.Tick();), Your App will automatically have a button script that runs OnAppOpen, this will also automatically open your app screen you made. 
    }
}
```
If You Want To Create A Button, Use Our Built In System:
```csharp

public override void AppContent()
{
    base.AppContent();

    GameObject parent = Main.instance.AppInterfaces.transform.Find($"{AppName}App").gameObject;
    PadButton.Create(parent, "Obj", SelectedAudio.ButtonAudio, ButtonFunction);
}

void ButtonFunction()
{
    PadLogging.LogMessage("This Gets Ran When The Button Is Clicked");
}

```
